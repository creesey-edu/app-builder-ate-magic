          <div className="bg-muted p-6 md:p-8 rounded-xl border-l-4 border-primary shadow-sm space-y-4">
            <p>
              Chad Reesey didn‚Äôt stumble into tech ‚Äî he earned his way into it, one system, one lesson, and one mission-critical decision at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
              His journey started early, delivering newspapers at age 12 in small-town America ‚Äî learning consistency, self-reliance, and the value of earning every dollar. He went on to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout before graduating high school, a milestone rooted in perseverance and leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chad then enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and was deployed to Camp Eggers in downtown Kabul, Afghanistan. Officially a supply clerk, he operated as an information systems manager in a war zone ‚Äî keeping logistics online, managing infrastructure under pressure, and even supporting convoy operations in volatile conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              After returning home, Chad entered civilian IT and engineering, building secure systems, automating operations, modernizing tech stacks, and designing infrastructure that doesn‚Äôt just work ‚Äî it holds up under stress.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, as founder of The Angry Gamer Show and its tech stack, he‚Äôs building the tools he wishes he‚Äôd had: systems that are stable, secure, scalable, and developer-friendly. Chad leads with discipline, builds with intention, and treats every project like it needs to survive the unexpected ‚Äî because he knows some of them will.
            </p>

# Project Git Workflow Reference

This project uses a structured Git workflow for managing source code, feature development, and deployment. Below is a quick-reference guide to help team members perform common Git tasks correctly.

---

## üîÅ Switching Between Branches Without Committing

### Option 1: Stash Changes
```bash
git stash push -m "WIP: unsaved changes"
git switch target-branch
```
To restore later:
```bash
git stash pop
```

### Option 2: Temporary WIP Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: partial changes"
git switch target-branch
```
To undo:
```bash
git reset HEAD~1
```

### Option 3: `git switch` (If no conflicts)
```bash
git switch target-branch
```

## üîÄ Merging Working Branch into Development

1. Commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Feature complete"
```

2. Switch to `development`:
```bash
git switch development
```

3. Pull latest development branch:
```bash
git pull origin development
```

4. Merge your feature branch:
```bash
git merge your-branch-name
```

5. Push updated development:
```bash
git push origin development
```

6. (Optional) Clean up:
```bash
git branch -d your-branch-name
```

## üåê Managing Multiple Remotes

### Add a Secondary Remote
```bash
git remote add working git@github.com:your-org/project-working.git
```
Push to it:
```bash
git push working development
```

### Make a Remote Fetch-Only
```bash
git remote set-url --push origin no_push
```
Re-enable pushing:
```bash
git remote set-url --push origin git@github.com:your-org/project.git
```

### Rename a Remote
```bash
git remote rename origin source
```

---

## ‚úÖ Helpful Commands

- Show remotes:
```bash
git remote -v
```

- View stashes:
```bash
git stash list
```

- Apply a specific stash:
```bash
git stash apply stash@{0}
```

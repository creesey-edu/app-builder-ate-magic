# 🧪 Penetration Test Plan – The Angry Gamer Show Productions

## 🎯 Objective
To proactively identify vulnerabilities in our full-stack environment, validate mitigations from the threat model, and ensure secure development practices are effective across environments.

## 📆 Testing Schedule
| Test Type             | Frequency               | Notes                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Internal Manual Scan | Monthly                  | Performed by ISSO/Lead Dev       |
| Automated DAST       | Nightly or on Pull Merge | Integrated via CI/CD pipeline    |
| External Pen Test    | Quarterly or Pre-Release | Can be vendor- or ISSO-led       |

## 🛠️ Tools & Utilities
- **OWASP ZAP** – Automated web app scanning
- **Burp Suite (Community)** – Manual probing
- **Nikto** – Basic HTTP vulnerability scanner
- **Snyk / npm audit** – Dependency and SCA scanning
- **TruffleHog / GitLeaks** – Git secret scanning
- **Nmap / curl** – Manual network interaction

## 📦 Scope of Testing
| Component     | Endpoint / Feature            | Test Focus                            |
|---------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `frontend`    | `/auth/discord/login`         | CORS, redirect validation, input XSS  |
| `auth`        | `/api/auth/discord/token`     | Replay attacks, JWT injection         |
| `traefik`     | HTTPS entrypoint              | TLS, headers, HSTS                    |
| Env Secrets   | Docker volumes, shared mounts | Secret exposure, directory traversal  |
| Session Mgmt  | All login and token flows     | Expiration, fixation, hijack attempts |

## 🔐 Testing Credentials
- Use **non-production** environment
- Seed with **dummy Discord OAuth tokens** (do not test with real users)
- Ensure mirror of production config (headers, CORS, TLS, rate-limiting)

## 📋 Reporting Requirements
- All results stored in: `security/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/penetration-test-report.md`
- Each report must include:
  - Description of issue
  - Reproduction steps
  - Risk severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - Recommended mitigation
  - Status (Open, Mitigated, In Progress)
  - Assigned team/owner

## ✅ Pre-Release Sign-Off
Before production deployment, sign-off required from:
- [ ] Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
- [ ] Lead Developer
- [ ] QA Lead

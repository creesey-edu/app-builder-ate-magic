# 🛡️ Security Baseline Checklist

This checklist defines the **minimum security controls** required before any code, service, or infrastructure component is considered production-ready within The Angry Gamer Show Productions.

Use this as a gating mechanism for deployments, feature releases (such as JWT introduction), and security reviews.

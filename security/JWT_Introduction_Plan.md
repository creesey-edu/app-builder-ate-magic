# 🔑 JWT Introduction Plan – The Angry Gamer Show Productions

This plan outlines the secure design, implementation, and operational strategy for introducing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) into the authentication architecture.

---

## 🧭 Objective
To implement JWT-based access control for authenticated users while ensuring robust security, auditability, and lifecycle management of issued tokens.

---

## 📦 Token Usage Model
| Type            | Purpose                          | Transport Method         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Access Token    | API access control (short-lived) | HTTP Header (Bearer)     |
| Refresh Token   | Token renewal (if implemented)   | HttpOnly Secure Cookie   |

---

## 🔐 JWT Claims Structure
| Claim   | Description                              | Required |
|---------|------------------------------------------|----------|
| `iss`   | Issuer (e.g., auth.thenagrygamershow.com) | ✅        |
| `sub`   | Subject (user ID or Discord ID)          | ✅        |
| `aud`   | Audience (e.g., `frontend.thenagry...`)   | ✅        |
| `exp`   | Expiration time (e.g., 15 min)           | ✅        |
| `iat`   | Issued at timestamp                      | ✅        |
| `jti`   | JWT ID (for revocation tracking)         | Optional |
| `scope` | Role/permission data                     | Optional |

---

## 📜 Signing & Verification
| Component         | Decision                                           |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Algorithm         | `RS256` (asymmetric) preferred over `HS256`       |
| Key storage       | Private key stored securely in `.env` or vault    |
| Key rotation      | Establish quarterly or emergency rotation process |
| Public key access | Available to frontend for verification (JWKS)     |

---

## 🔁 Token Lifecycle
- **Access Token TTL:** 15 minutes
- **Refresh Token TTL:** 7 days (HttpOnly cookie)
- **Re-issue Logic:** Only from trusted refresh endpoint
- **Revocation Strategy:**
  - Store invalidated `jti` values in Redis or DB
  - Rotate keys if major incident occurs

---

## 🚨 Security Considerations
- Use **HTTPS only** to transport tokens
- Never store tokens in `localStorage`
- Use `SameSite=Strict` and `Secure` flags for cookies
- Validate `aud` and `iss` for every inbound token
- Leverage middleware for auto-verification

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
| Test                          | Description                                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Signature validation          | Reject tokens with bad or missing signature  |
| Expired token behavior        | Verify rejection of stale tokens             |
| Replay protection             | Ensure JWT ID (`jti`) uniqueness (optional)  |
| Scope enforcement             | Ensure RBAC logic is respected               |
| Revoked token rejection       | Simulate revocation list lookup              |

---

## ✅ Go-Live Requirements
Before deploying JWTs to production, the following requirements must be met:

- [ ] **Keys generated and stored securely** (use .env, secrets manager, or vault)
- [ ] **Middleware integrated** for verifying JWTs on every protected route
- [ ] **Signature validation tested** with malformed and expired tokens
- [ ] **Access/Refresh token TTL documented** and approved
- [ ] **Revocation mechanism operational** (e.g., Redis blacklist or key rotation)
- [ ] **Security headers set** (`Strict-Transport-Security`, `Cache-Control`, etc.)
- [ ] **Audit logging enabled** for token issuance and refresh attempts
- [ ] **CI/CD pipelines updated** to run token validation and regression tests
- [ ] **Staging environment tested** with real token flows end-to-end
- [ ] **Documentation completed** for support, dev, and incident response teams
